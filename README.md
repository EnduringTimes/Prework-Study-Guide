# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

- I wanted to challenge myself to learn somthing new so I built a basic webpage with the help of material from my coding bootcamp prework.
This webpage that was created can help keep notes in a easy to read manner that can be viewed from almost anywhere.
Through the process of the Prework STudy Guides creation I learned how to format with HTML, Style with CSS and Learned the basics
of JavaScript implementation.
